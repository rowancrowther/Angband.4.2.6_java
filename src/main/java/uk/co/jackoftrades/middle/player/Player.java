/**
 * The player - the port of C's {@code struct player} (player.h), and the central mutable object of a
 * game in progress. It gathers everything about the current character: identity (race, class, name,
 * history), the birth and derived statistics, position and depth, resources (HP, SP, gold, food,
 * energy), the timed effects and options in force, the body plan and any assumed shape, the carried
 * gear, and the transient per-turn bookkeeping held in {@link PlayerUpkeep}.
 *
 * <p>The middle layer reaches the live player through the swappable
 * {@link uk.co.jackoftrades.middle.game.gameengine.GameState#getPlayer()} seam rather than a global,
 * so there is exactly one player during play and a test can install its own.
 *
 * <p>This is a work in progress: many fields of C's {@code struct player} are present but not yet
 * wired up, and several methods below are deliberate stubs - individually noted - awaiting the
 * subsystems they depend on.
